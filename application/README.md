# Cloud Microservices Demo Application

This project is based on the [original open-source microservices demo from Weaveworks](https://github.com/microservices-demo). Information about the application architecture can be found [here](https://github.com/microservices-demo/microservices-demo/blob/master/internal-docs/design.md).

At the moment does this repository contain Docker files with the changes needed to add AppDynamics instrumentation and modify company names, etc.

This demo application is intended to run on a Kubernetes and can be deployed using helm.
